### Hi, I'm Fabricio Barth ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Today, my main interest is how to build autonomous systems using machine learning and artificial intelligence's concepts and tools in a large scale.
- ðŸŒ± In my projects you will see a lot of examples of supervised and unsupervised learning, including reinforcement learning. The recent implementations are in Python, but the old ones are in R.
- ðŸ¤˜ There are also generic things, like the implementation of search algorithms.
- :octocat: Sorry! But there some projects are very old (8 or 10 years ago) and a little disorganized. There are also a lot of documents, but the majority are in Portuguese because I'm from Brazil.
