### Hi, I'm Fabricio Barth ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Today, my main interest is how to build autonomous systems using machine learning and artificial intelligence's concepts and tools in a large scale.
- ðŸŒ± In my projects, you will see a lot of examples of supervised and unsupervised learning, including reinforcement learning. The new implementations are in Python, but the old ones are in R.
- ðŸ¤˜ There are also generic things, like the implementation of search algorithms.
- :octocat: I'm trying to keep all the projects organized. But, this is a little hard. So, be prepared! There are a lot of disorganized projects! Some of them have README files and so on. But, there are a lot of documents in Portuguese because I'm from Brazil.
